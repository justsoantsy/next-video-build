# About Dragverse
We are building to build the dragverse, a web app where fans can connect with others, post, mirror, and collect posts from drag creators and others in the community. Those who apply to become creators can live-stream their art and mint these videos as collectibles that their communities can collect for free, auctioned items, or at a set price. All thanks to recent blockchain technologies and protocols like Lense and Livepeer.

## Our achievements during Next Video Build
As new programmers and builders, we are so hyped that we accomplish a lot with the community:
We started with what we were comfortable with: UX/UI and what we wanted to accomplish. Including Livestreaming with Livepeer and XMPT Chat, Home Feed, and Login Page. 
We did more research into how our audience is using live streaming. We gathered data about use cases and how the community consumed content and identified the must-have features.
We learned how to create a React App.
We connected Livepeer Client and Player.
We live-streamed using OBS.
We connected ReadyPlayerMe Avatar Builder.
